# Welcome to `bcdiHackweek`

Here will reside all the information you will need to participate in the `bcdiHackweek` between October 4-8 2021.
The bcdi git repo is [here](https://github.com/carnisj/bcdi)
The discord channel [here](https://discord.com/channels/859334879757467698/859334880247808055)
The silent capture Anonymous google doc is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B9MKEdgktdxxEO2JgL62WQXSewWJnGTcvgaQ8EE3WKc/edit?usp=sharing)

## Deliverables
* Every user is a contributor - make it clear how to interact with the bcdi package so everyone can gain

* Make everyone comfortable with the concepts and workflow in order to contribute and profit

* Clean the repo + identify what is missing

* Integrate stuff already done that is languishing in ocean of data analysis already done.

* define the future for the bcdi package

## Schedule overview
The first day will be a primer for GIT, how to interact and communicate through the repository efficiently and why this is important.

EUROPEAN TIME (09:00-12:00) - (14:00-18:00) - (21:00-24:00)  

The core time (14:00-18:00) is consistent across half the world, optimal coverage for participants already interested.

I intend to host the meeting continuously so in principle anyone can drop in and meet people etc etc. The two other time slots will be drop in clinics, where ideally 1 or more people are available for problem solving.


Should the primer be the day before or the data after the package is really introduced?

## 20211004 (Day 1) Primer

1 hours of tutorial  JC  (how to use github/how to communicate with github and discord)

1 hour of ask us anything  + coffee break           

1 hours of tutorial    (jupyter tips and tricks / other / dealing with the data deluge)

1 hour of ask us anything   + coffee break   

have a git helpdesk - 3 people to go directly to in order to get help with git.

## 20211005 (Day 2)

who and what?  data analysis reproducibility/ transparency and progress

`14:00 - 14:15` Steven Leake - why we are here and how this is going to work.

`14:20 - 14:50` Jerome Carnis - history - overview of the package

`15:00 - 15:30` Ross Harder - Cohere package

tutorials /examples on the basic functionality for each submodule

* `pre processing`  - Ni Li??
* `post processing`   - Maxime Dupraz
* `facet recognition`   - Marie-Ingrid Richard
* grouped  - Jerome Carnis

  `publication`     
  `simulation`      
  `utils`           
  `xcca`            

each of the above should be done by a single different person  (+recorded) followed by a 5-XX minute feedback on potential extension /reduction etc.  This should generate a series of issues to be added to github and serve as the basis for days 2-5

contributed use cases - functionality demonstration

example command line - script - jupyter etc / david's gui

open discussion what do you like / don't like / what is not clear/ what is missing etc etc / what shouldn't be there i.e. is done better elsewhere

output file hdf5 etc etc cxi databank talk. Zenodo for repo consistency when  publishing - could be brought up in the publication section

need for unit tests

## 20211006 (Day 3)

repository purge - is everything in the right place

documentation purge - every function have a definition (understandable)

function purge - anything duplicated / done better elsewehere

Rank issues in terms of priority or just begin ticking them off, depending on the number of participants.

define some sprints, split into working groups - have 1-2 floating moderators for help, try to put a mix of expertise in the different groups.

need for unit tests?

need for new examples?

mini projects + mini project demos  >> what has been developed / who wants to show it off.


## 20211007 (Day 4)
repeat day 3
## 20211008 (Day 5)
repeat day 3 until no issues left

Finale - summary of the week/ however long it was.  How do we continue? does this become a regular activity? or if you are having problems submit an issue so everyone can see it and how it was solved.


## Code of Conduct

`bcdiHackweek` is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
Sexual images in public spaces
Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
Harassing photography or recording
Sustained disruption of talks or other events
Inappropriate physical contact
Unwelcome sexual attention
Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from `bcdiHackweek` with no refund.

`bcdiHackweek` organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all the event venues and event-related social activities.

Reporting a violation
Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of `bcdiHackweek` for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to one of the instructors. You can make a report either personally or anonymously. Anonymous reports can be made here.

This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.

Group discussion
Q: What can each of us do to make the `bcdiHackweek` an optimal learning environment that is inclusive and welcoming for everyone?

Be respectful to others’ views; whether it’s technical question or scientific hypothesis
Be inclusive regardless of technical expertise and career stage (emphasize the growth mindset)
Acknowledge contributions
Avoid irony and bad jokes
“Silent Capture”: a google doc for people who feel uncomfortable speaking, so that ideas get captured
Try to avoid a small number of people dominating the conversation
Moderator in small groups
Encourage quiet group members their opinion - give space for different styles of communication.
Ask rather than assume
Be aware of the time zones of your coworkers
Be mindful of how your verbal communication might be received without body language (yay virtual!)
Recognize we have different working environments right now (kids, partners sharing the internet, other pandemic/work - from home challenges)
Be aware that face-to-face interaction may not translate perfectly when we message each other on Discord.
Don’t force others to turn on a microphone or webcam. There may be circumstances you are not aware of.
Get to know each other
Make sure people are on the same page and none is completely lost
Try to be gentle
