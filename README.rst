BCDI: tools for pre(post)-processing Bragg and forward coherent X-ray diffraction imaging data
==============================================================================================

Introduction
============

BCDI stands for *Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging*. It can be used for:

* pre-processing BCDI and forward CDI data (masking aliens, detector gaps ...) before
  phase retrieval

* post-processing after phase retrieval (phase offset and phase ramp removal, averaging,
  apodization, ...)

* data analysis on diffraction data (stereographic projection, angular
  cross-correlation analysis, domain orientation fitting ...)

* data analysis on phased data (resolution calculation, statistics on the retrieved
  strain ...)

* simulation of diffraction intensity (including noise, detector gaps, displacement
  field ...)

* creating figures for publication using templates

Considering that most parts of the analysis pipeline are actually beamline-independent,
we tried to reuse as much as possible code, and leverage inheritance when it comes to
facility or beamline-dependent details.

BCDI as a python toolkit
========================

BCDI can be used as a python library with the following main modules:

1) :mod:`bcdi.algorithms`: PSF and image deconvolution using Richardson-Lucy algorithm

2) :mod:`bcdi.experiment`: definition of the experimental geometry
   (beamline, setup, detector, diffractometer...).

3) :mod:`bcdi.graph` : generation of plots using predefined templates.

4) :mod:`bcdi.postprocessing`: methods for post-processing the complex output
   of a phasing algorithm. Stereographic projection of a diffraction peak or a
   reconstructed crystal. Automatic detection of reconstructed facets and statistics on
   facet strain.

5) :mod:`bcdi.preprocessing`: methods for pre-processing the diffraction
   intensity in Bragg CDI or forward CDI geometry.

6) :mod:`bcdi.simulation`: in BCDI geometry, calculation of the diffraction intensity
   based on FFT or kinematical sum. It can include a displacement field, noise,
   detector gaps etc... In forward CDI geometry, calculation of the Bragg peak
   positions in 3D for a mesocrystal, knowing the unit cell and unit cell parameter.

7) :mod:`bcdi.utils`: generic functions about data loading, fitting functions, cropping/
   padding, image registration, validation functions ...

8) :mod:`bcdi.xcca`: X-ray cross-correlation analysis related methods

The central module is :mod:`bcdi.experiment`, which contains all setup-related
implementation. This is the place where to look at if you want to add support for a new
beamline or detector.

  silx, xrayutilities

* lmfit: for scripts performing fits

* pytest: to run the tests

* pytables: to load the devices dictionnary for SIXS data

* moviepy, `imagemagick <https://imagemagick.org>`_ or

Download & Installation
=======================

BCDI is available from:

* the Python Package Index: ``python -m pip install bcdi``
* or on `GitHub <https://github.com/carnisj/bcdi>`_, where you will find the latest
  version:

|  - to install the main branch, type:
|    ``python -m pip install git+https://github.com/carnisj/bcdi.git``
|  - to install a specific branch, type:
|    ``python -m pip install git+https://github.com/carnisj/bcdi.git@branch_name``

Add the flag ``--upgrade`` to the commands above in order to update an existing
installation.

Note that there are issues with installing scikit-image within an Anaconda environment.
In such situation, the workaround is to create instead a virtual environment using pip.

If you want to contribute to bcdi development, install also extra dependencies:
``python -m pip install bcdi[dev]``

Please send feedback in `GitHub issues <https://github.com/carnisj/bcdi/issues>`_.
